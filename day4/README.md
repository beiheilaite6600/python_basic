## Day4 Conditional Statements

### Syntax Format

```
if condition: 
    if - block 
elif condition: 
    elif - block 
else:  
    else - block
```

Hint: 
1. elif and else branches are optional.   
2. in Python, if the condition value is False, 0, None, "", (), {}, [], then will be recognized as False by the parser. 
3. mutilple elif branches are allowed, however only one else is allow and should be in the last condition branch.
